# Segmentation-for-a-Telecom-Operator
A national telecom provider wants to move from one-size-fits-all marketing to data-driven customer segmentation. By uncovering natural clusters in their customer base, they hope to: Tailor retention strategies (reduce churn among high-risk groups)   Design targeted offers (upsells, cross-sells, bundles)   Allocate support resources more efficiently
Case Study: Customer Segmentation for a Telecom Operator
1. Business Context
A national telecom provider wants to move from one-size-fits-all marketing to data-driven customer segmentation. By uncovering natural clusters in their customer base, they hope to:
Tailor retention strategies (reduce churn among high-risk groups)


Design targeted offers (upsells, cross-sells, bundles)


Allocate support resources more efficiently


Challenge: Without pre-labeled segments, use unsupervised learning to discover actionable groups and propose business actions.

MonthlyCharges
Numeric
The amount charged to the customer monthly
Continuous, approx. $18.25 – $118.75
TotalCharges
Numeric
The total amount charged to the customer over their entire tenure
Continuous, approx. $18.80 – $8,859.50 (11 missing)
Churn
Binary*
Whether the customer has left within the last month (for evaluation only—exclude from clustering)
“Yes”, “No”



3. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
Missing Values


Identify any missing or anomalous TotalCharges entries.


Decide: drop or impute—and justify your choice.


Feature Selection


Choose which features to include in clustering.


Which categorical variables will you encode? How?


Which binaries will you map to 0/1?


Scaling


Decide on and apply a scaling method (e.g. StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler).


Explain why scaling is (or isn’t) necessary for your selected features.


Dimensionality Reduction (Optional)


Consider PCA or t-SNE for visualization—do you apply it before or after clustering?



4. Determining the Number of Clusters
Elbow Method: Plot inertia (WCSS) vs. k.


Silhouette Analysis: Compute average silhouette scores for different k.


Business Interpretability: Balance metric “best k” with actionable segment count.


Task: Produce both plots, choose a final k, and justify your decision in business terms.

5. Clustering Exercise
Apply K-Means (or another clustering algorithm of your choice).


Assign cluster labels back to the original dataframe.


Validate cluster stability (e.g., run with different random seeds).


Questions:
Which algorithm did you choose and why?


How sensitive are your clusters to initialization/parameters?



6. Cluster Profiling
Compute summary statistics (mean, median, mode, percentages) of key features for each cluster.


Identify distinctive traits: e.g. “high monthly spend, short tenure, fiber customers.”


Deliverable: A profile table for each cluster and a brief narrative business label (e.g. “Budget Newcomers,” “Loyal High-Value Users,” etc.).

7. Visualization
2D Projection: Use PCA or t-SNE to create a scatter plot colored by cluster.


Feature Charts: Bar plots or boxplots comparing clusters on:


Tenure


MonthlyCharges


InternetService types


Contract type


Tip: Keep plots clean and annotated—these visuals will guide your business recommendations.

8. Business Recommendations
For each segment, propose at least one specific action:
Retention: Which clusters are at highest churn risk? What offers or communications would you design?


Upsell/Cross-sell: Which clusters have potential for add-on services?


New Acquisition: How might you target look-alike prospects in the market?


Task: Write a short action plan (2–3 bullet points per segment).
